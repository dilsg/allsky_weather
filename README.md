Adaption of the DanielGallo-script for TJ-Allsky. 
I wanted to use the script of Daniel Gallo for my allsky-installation in the overlay section.
For that I have to define my own valiables. I called it DS_WETTER.
My new script index-ds.js create a json-file with the structur:

{"DS_WETTER": {  "value": "
--- Data from the originasl DanielGallo script with always \n at the EndOfLines
"}}

With this file in the extra-file-directory ~/allsky/config/overlay/extra/
you can use the variable DS_WETTER in the overlay-editor.
